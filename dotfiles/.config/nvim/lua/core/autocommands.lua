    -- When opening the help buffer, upon open, set the buffer to the right most vertical split.
    -- The winwidth() check is to determine whether a help buffer is already open, if so, do not issue the wincmd.
    -- The reason for this is because telescope.nvim issues a close window command when closing the prompt buffer and when
    -- the BufEnter event is triggered which then tries to issue the wincmd, you will get an error stating that a split
    -- cannot be issued while a window is closing.
